# Instructions for Running my Project

Hello class! 

My program is faily simple.  As it stands there is no need to download any libraries.  All  you will need to do is run the program and follow the prompts.  I have left instructions within the code that tells you the format that I am looking for when I ask for the users input.  I have also included ValueError exceptions, so if you are the type of person who has a hard time following instructions, the program shouldnt crash until you give it what it wants!. 

The program will ask you for the amount of loan you have taken out, interest rate, and the number of months it will take you to payoff your loan.  After the program takes down the financial info, it will ask you for the date that you will make your first payment.  

Once you have put in your date, the program will calculate the monthly payment required to payoff your loan in the designated months. It will then show you how much interest you will pay, and the total amount paid principle + interest. My program will even tell you the date you are exptected to pay off the loan, as long as you dont miss any payments of course!
